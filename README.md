# Clyde API (Local)
The API used by [Clyde](https://github.com/ClydeReborn/Clyde) to get all the \*local\* ChatGPT results out, straight to you.

## Running
Don't run it by itself unless you intend to host a ChatGPT API online without plugging it into Clyde.<br>
See the instructions on [Clyde](https://github.com/ClydeReborn/Clyde) to get everything configured.<br>
For this version you also need to setup [Ollama](https://ollama.com).
